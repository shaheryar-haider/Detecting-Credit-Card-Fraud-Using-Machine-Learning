# Detecting-Credit-Card-Fraud-Using-Machine-Learning

# Overview
This project aims to detect fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions in credit card data utilizing the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU). The model's performance is evaluated using precision, recall, and F1-score metrics to assess its effectiveness in identifying fraudulent activities.

# Classification Metrics
The classification metrics for the model are as follows:

# Model Performance Metrics

F1-Score:
Fraudulent Transactions: 0.90
Non-Fraudulent Transactions: 0.90

Precision:
Fraudulent Transactions: 0.88
Non-Fraudulent Transactions: 0.94

Recall:
Fraudulent Transactions: 0.92
Non-Fraudulent Transactions: 0.94

Accuracy: 0.93

# Model Architecture
The shallow neural network architecture comprises a few layers, with ReLU activation functions employed to introduce non-linearity. The model is trained using backpropagation and stochastic gradient descent to minimize the classification loss.

# Dependencies
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed to run the model:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
